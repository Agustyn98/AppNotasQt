--PROGRESS:

Also add a color combobox, for bold, underline and italic just use shortcuts


BLOCKED:
fix menu size and items
    can't get the menu combobox to be smaller


TODO:
    VISUAL:
        set the icon
        info dialog look better (ask chatgpt)
    OPERATIONAL:
        BUG on dev branch, things not getting saved on the first type >:( -?
        font sizes
            Make a separate config line for textbox default size, and buttons to change it -!
            I probably need to save the last font size when the app is closed
        
        Do something about search note background getting saved, I can't clear it every time I save
            Now removing the background saves the note, when it shouldn't
        synchronise in cloud
        

FUTURE:
rich text in edittext
pinning or unpinning shouldn't update the last mod timestamp
ctrl z redos to much
encrypt db
color of widgets when hovered over
