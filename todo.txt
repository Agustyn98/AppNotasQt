DONE:


--PROGRESS:
Add new font size combobox in ui, make it change the selected text size
Also add a color combobox, for bold, underline and italic just use shortcuts


BLOCKED:
fix menu size and items
    can't get the menu combobox to be smaller


TODO:
    VISUAL:
        set the icon
        info dialog look better (ask chatgpt)
    OPERATIONAL:
        BUG on dev branch, things not getting saved on the first type >:( -?
            it happens when you switch from a note to another one that has the exact same title
        
        synchronise in cloud
        pinning or unpinning shouldn't update the last mod timestamp
            You don't need to update the pin on textchanged event
        

FUTURE:
encrypt db
ctrl z redos to much
color of widgets when hovered over
